This is a draft. If you're browsing my GitHub and are reading this, please take it with a grain of salt.

Here are my available openings.. based on estimations

In addition to my open source projects, these are area I'd like to work in:

There may be others. Certainly something directly related to one of these things, or an open source project,
would be very interesting to me. Please DO NOT tell me how your advertising company is developing it's own ad
markup language that is like HTML7 dude.

Drop me at line on gmail@devinrhode2 with answers to the following questions:

1. What is the actual work that you need done? How time-sensitive is it?

2. What is your complete development setup process? Ideally this is already documented and you can just copy-paste and send it to me. What are all your server client and tooling technologies? Grunt, Backbone, Rails, PHP, Closure Compiler, JSHint, Coffeescript?

I do appreciate a higher price for a little more pressure, perhaps $60/hr reflects my desired ratio.

I like working day and night, non-stop.
Open Source overlap:
If the first thing I start doing for your project is doing some open source component,
then you're getting very high quality code. Most businesses have a clear core competency.
Especially on the server, I'm not going to just open source things. On the client,
I believe the upside of open source usually outweighs a loss in a competitive edge.
I will keep it absolutely secret that I am working for you. Say, hypothetically, I was contracting for Apple.
Furthermore, let's pretend I was working on a mobile web version of maps.
That would probably lead me to work on certain open source projects.

In open source projects, it's not uncommon for maintainers to ask for a good clear use case for some feature.
This is where my creativity and abstraction comes into play. If a use case I explain is too abstract, then I will forgo
revealing anything about the company and instead fork the project. Things get messy here and I may need help, not
pressure or negativity. To this end, it's important that you care about open source. If you don't care about open
source, then you may need to re-consider hiring an open source developer for a project.
