The men at 404 are looking for a group of 3-5 girls to have some group dinners with on friday or saturday nights. If it goes well we could have dinners regularly and form a solid friend group, if the first dinner doesn't go well, it will surely be an interesting experience. If we're having dinners regularly, we can plan ahead and buy in bulk to save money and time cooking. By having some authentic but platonic friends of your desired gender, you are in a good position to find love, either with this friend or by meeting a friend of theirs. If we can create a good core group of friends that involves mostly equal amounts of guys and girls,  We create a great foundation forAlso by hanging out regularly, we have a great foundation for hosting really great parties. 

Perhaps further in the future we can plan some physical activity before dinners, have more than one dinner a week, etc. After dinner we play strategic card and board games. Once we start getting bored with playing games, we could plan come outings. The goal is to have a fantastic, somewhat structured friend group. 

Devin, Mason, Manny, and Rey consider our apartment one of the best living situations we have ever had. We are looking for another happy healthy residence of girls to socialize and be friends with. By taking two groups that already value the group above any other individual of the group, we hope to create a cross-gender group that also puts the group before any individual of the group.

After our dinners, we can have some awesome parties, as big or small as we want.

Also, in-between games, we can have story telling.

But of course to get there, you need to start off with just hosting open inclusive dinners, only later on becoming exclusive. Perhaps every friday night after food is put away shortly after 9, a party could be hosted at 9:30.

I want to form a gender balanced group of 8-10 highly intelligent and creative individuals with diverse sexual orientations and ethnicities who prioritize the whole group above any certain individuals of the group.

The ultimate core value of the group is our physical and mental health.

Every week, at least 3 days a week, we get together for some physical activity, then food, then some strategic card and board games. Exactly what 3 days of the week we get together depends on the needs of the members of the group. We should meetup at least every friday or saturday where we enjoy a glass of wine, but for any more you'll have to pay for that yourself. The latest a gathering should officially go till would be about 10:40 to cater to early risers, dinner is served around 8:30, food is put away shortly after 9. We could meet saturday or sunday during the day too, and these time constraints don't apply. 

We pick the days that most of us can attend. Members are not welcome to attend when they want to - if they don't want to attend they shouldn't be part of the group.

A friday or saturday would be nice to have a non-hostile environment to drink or smoke weed, not both.

A member should always be more committed to the whole group than any one individual or certain individuals of the group. 
You aren't welcome to be a member of the group unless you are more committed to the group than you would ever be to any individual. If two individuals in the group miss one meeting, their whereabouts will be questioned and if they spent the time with each other, they are automatically removed from the group, but can re-apply in 2 weeks. The group is here for you to make many great bonds. The group is not here for you to find a lover and stop caring about the group.

The dinners need to be as organic and non-gmo as possible, and will occur every saturday or friday, depending on the needs of the group.

You are welcome to attend four group dinners as a guest, and can then choose to become a member or not.

There's nothing wrong with smoking pot, but we are forming a group focused on our physical and mental health. We do not want to be a group that encourages smoking pot, we aren't going to chastise it, but we aren't going to broadcast anything about it, even if asked. If an individual seems high, and someone asks if they are high, the answer should always be "yes", because our goal is to get high, preferably just by natural means.

An individual is not welcome to invite others to smoke pot during a group dinner, nor are they welcome to share that they are going to smoke pot
If an individual plans to get high at or during one of the group dinners,  it should not be done in front of the group, but a pot-smoking individual can leave very briefly to take a hit or two in the bathroom. That individual can 

 Committing yourself to one individual of the group is grounds for expulsion

You aren't allowed into the grou
You need to be committed to the group be

You aren't allowed to be in a committed relationship with any one person

Why:

The whole group is more important than any subset of the group - this is about unity.

While dating is fun and enticing, I found it works against my values of harmony. I find pictures also detract from what really matters: pizza. Pizza is all that matters when we are friends.

My orientation isn't actually "Questioning" I'm just putting that because I will approach you about a romantic and/or sexual engagement later.

So why be friends with me? idk, I think I'll write that sexshun later, but for now my previous dating profile that follows is pretty descriptive of who I am.

Programmer/entrepreneur (ENTJ) with ADHD living on 18th and Alder (The Sonja) people to teach programming and pair program with.

As an ENTJ, I think I have more stable interactions and experiences with Thinking types, and suspect I generally have more fun with iNtuitive(theoretical/abstract) types. I'll date most people but if you're a feeling type I'll add a tablespoon of caution.

I really really value my health. I think a lot about my physiology and psychology. I'm pretty high energy because I'm so healthy and fit.

I love:
– rap, pop, EDM
– Nutritious food, fruits, veggies, I focus on nutrients and physiology and their effect on me. Protein helps with ADHD, sugar makes it worse.
– video games, board games, card games (recently hooked on chess.com)
– Ideas. Writing down, sketching, discussing and sharing them. I'm very theoretical, abstract, and analytical. I never stop thinking.

– Helping people
– Open minded understanding people
– Raw, honest personal dialog
– Deep philosophical discussions, especially long into the night.

– Acting like a goof
– Costumes
– Painting and drawing whatever comes to mind
– Plays!

Being active!
• Walking. Any time of the day or night.
• Hiking, swimming, camping
• Rock climbing!
• Dancing
• Anything really

I'm very theoretical, hypothetical, abstract, full of ideas, and future focused. I live in a world of possibilities, I know the world is your oyster (N)
Small preference for logic over emotion (T)
More organized than disorganized (J)
I'm equally extroverted/introverted, but I've been making a point to hangout with people more often lately

I love learning everything in the world:
• GMO's, Wall Street, DC, fishy financial activities, the middle east, war, the money flow;
• Human rights and equality, Psychology
..We need private secure communication in order to organize a dumping of the USD. Research the Federal Reserve. We all need to stop joining the military. Fighting is obviously not the answer.

I always give people the benefit of the doubt, avoid criticizing others at all costs, and instead focus on understanding people. Sincere appreciation is really easy to give, and does so much for another person's spirit. I like to keeping positive karma.

Ends breed beginnings, I know how to cut losses; the challenge is predicting upward or downward progress

I believe in evolution and really value learning how to live a better life in a holistic and highly objective sense. I really value my physical and mental health.

The classic formula for connecting with someone you don't know:
1. Point out things we have in common
2. Ask the other person about one of their interests.
I try to do this and hope that you also note the things we have in common as you read my profile.
