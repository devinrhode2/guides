### WORK HISTORY

#### Early life:

 * In my childhood I was a classic yahoo and a nerd. Sometimes slacker, sometimes A-student.
 * I was in Boy Scouts for 5 years and then Upward Bound for 4, visiting
 * 9th grade: Delivered papers everyday for 1 year. Started working hard in school.
 * 10th grade: Moved to better school. McDonald's for 1 year. Purchased laptop and car. Wanted to be a a physicist when I grow up.

 * 11th grade: Thanks to a special program in Minnesota, I went to a Community College. I did lots of tutoring. Initially volunteering, and later for pay from the college. I also did extra tutoring on the side. A few months later I started a computer repair service Snap Speed Computer Care. When the iPad was released in 2010, the freedom to make my own apps for a living with no boss motivated me to start teaching myself a bit of C++.
   - By assiting seniors with their computers, I developed a strong interest in making technology easy to use.
   - I became very skilled at searching Google and started getting ideas about how to improve the experience.
   - When a peer claimed he knew more about computers than me, I recruited him as my partner. When he later quit, I was somehow even more motivated to do great work.

 * 12th grade: Studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
    - My dad insisted I move out instead of commute two hours everyday. When I turned 18 day the before school started, that's exactly what happened. Out and off to college one year ahead of my peers.

After I learned how to program fall semester, I spent my winter break figuring out how to make searching google faster and more streamlined, with a little success (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLZW_NIQKyk). I started learning all things web, and this is the time when my StackOverflow and Github accounts were created: December 2010.

With inspiration from The Social Network, help from friends, and disappointment that the apparently great foursquare just didn't connect me with my friends in real life, I started a social network called HitMeUp. I wanted to know when my friends were free to hangout and where they are.
  - Vanilla LAMP stack, we weren't even using source control (puke)
  - Post and get status updates via SMS with Twilio
  - Also created a chrome extension that mixed the elements of HMU directly into Facebook
  - Started building a small team

I also joined a fraternity spring semester, only because this one specifically didn't pressure you to drink at all. I made great friends and learned what it means to be a gentleman. Eventually I tried drinking and found it enjoyable, pushing my comfort zone and making me more confident. (Having a strong fear of alchohol would be mostly harmful for most people in america)


 * YouTube AdBlock extension - 1,500+ downloads

Since I was learning more working on HitMeUp and school was getting in the way of this, I had no motivation to finish 3 more years of computer science at this institution.

I was soon introduced to the unpredictability of software when I finished my mothers friends wordpress site for her antique shop. I threw out some estimation but my hours ended up double what I had expected. I think I made about minimum wage on that project, but rightfully so because I had such little experience at this point.

Chrome Extension: Fixed Facebook to show all friends online
  - My friends started complaining and I started coding - this extension peaked at 1,356 downloads.

I then moved to Minneapolis and worked for a solo founder in an incubator program, but ended up leaving in frustration when he simply wouldn't understand that city and state can be found given a zip code, and that users only need to enter a zip code.

I immediately accepted an offer from Refactr, a local development consulting firm. After finishing a chrome extension for one of their applications (MileMarker), I was left without any very meaningful work, and left a few weeks later.

I was then left to work on Scout all day everyday, and this was my core focus for the next 10 months. I learned javascript, the chrome extension api, iframes, crazy css selectors, and a lot more about frontend development and javascript.

During these 10 months is when I moved to Silicon Valley. I continued doing freelance development for a handful of startups, with each one this time focusing on frontend/javascript development. When I officially launched Scout, June 2012, I was at a cross-roads. I felt sufficiently satisified with my progress on the extension and logically I should blog and stuff to gain traction. I went hunting for a good blog engine, but just couldn't find anything good enough. Following the build it yourself policy, I went searching for a great framework to build the better blog engine on. I dove deeper and deeper into open source and can say it's now one of my true

Amobee, JavaScript Developer, Redwood City, March 2013 - August 2013 (4 months)
  Developed ads in a propietary ad xml language, and created development tools for abstracting and re-using chunks of xml.
  I used EJS initially, it was then agreed upon pure xml isn't powerful enough, and I wrote tool with grunt to compile jade to xml.

TrackIf, JavaScript Development, December 2012 - March 2013
  Made first version of chrome extension bookmarklet and safari extension. Though it's been a year, I can proudly say the basic architecture is still the same. The loading animation is a little bit more choppy, but is still pretty good.
