Instead of a traditional resume that gives you very little depth into my personality, I'm trying something new and am presenting my education, side projects, work and other experiences mixed together in a **chronological** story-like fashion. I believe this timeline combined with an interview will paint a very accurate picture of who I am so you can make a very informed hiring decision.

Objective:
Find work that maximizes my autonomy

 * HTML5 Geolocation, localStorage, placeholders, WebSockets, CSS3 transitions, transforms, animations, etc...

 * Ember, Angular, Backbone...

## HISTORY

#### Before programming:

 * Childhood: classic yahoo and nerd. Sometimes A-student.
 * I was in Boy Scouts for 5 years and Upward Bound for 4, visiting Florida Idaho DC and Chicago. I believe these groups helped give me a well balanced personality. I discovered I was a natural born leader.
 * 9th grade: Delivered papers everyday for 1 year. Started working pretty hard in school.
 * 10th grade: Moved to better school. McDonald's for 1 year. Purchased laptop and car. Wanted to be a a physicist when I grow up.

 * 11th grade: Thanks to a special program in Minnesota, I went to a Community College. I did lots of tutoring. Initially volunteering, and later for pay from the college. I also did extra tutoring on the side. A few months later I started a computer repair service Snap Speed Computer Care. When the iPad was released in 2010, the freedom to make my own apps for a living with no boss motivated me to start teaching myself a bit of C++.
   - By assisting seniors with their computers, I developed a strong interest in making technology easy to use.
   - I became very skilled at searching Google and started getting ideas about how to improve the experience.
   - When a peer claimed he was more qualified than me, I recruited him as my partner. When he later quit, I rose to the challenge even more motivated than ever.

 * 12th grade: **Studied Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Duluth**
   - My dad insisted I move out instead of commute two hours everyday. When I turned 18 day the before school started, that's exactly what happened. Out and off to college one year ahead of my peers.

### *Learned how to program\*

After I learning how to program fall semester, I started figuring out how to make searching google faster and more streamlined, with a little success (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLZW_NIQKyk). I started learning all things web, and this is the time when my StackOverflow and Github accounts were created: December 2010.

#### Spring Semester

With inspiration from The Social Network, help from friends, and disappointment that the apparently great foursquare just didn't connect me with my friends in real life, I started a social network called HitMeUp. I wanted to know when my friends were free to hangout and where they were.

  - Plain LAMP stack, but we did use source control!
  - Post and get status updates via SMS with Twilio
  - Also created a chrome extension that mixed the elements of HMU directly into Facebook
  - Started building a small team

I also joined a fraternity spring semester, only because this one specifically didn't pressure you to drink at all. I made great friends and learned what it meant to be a gentleman.

 * YouTube AdBlock extension - 1,500+ downloads

Since I was learning more working on HitMeUp and school was getting in the way of this, I had no motivation to finish 3 more years of computer science at this institution.

I was soon introduced to the unpredictability of software when I finished my mothers friends Wordpress site for her antique shop. I threw out some estimation but my hours ended up double what I had expected. I think I made about minimum wage on that project, but rightfully so because I had such little experience at this point.

Chrome Extension: Fixed Facebook to show all friends online
  - My friends started complaining and I started coding - this extension peaked at 1,356 downloads.

After working mostly on HitMeUp for 
 * Scout, Chrome Extension, TheScoutApp.com, August 2011– November 2012
   - Reformats Google results into a ((two-pane view)) sidebar, opening the first result in the main view. You can view 5 results in 5 clicks, instead of 10 with regular Google
   - Clever hacks for framing any website.

I then moved to Minneapolis and worked for a solo founder in an incubator program, but ended up leaving in frustration when he simply wouldn't understand that city and state can be found given a zip code, and that users only need to enter a zip code.

I immediately accepted an offer from Refactr, a local development consulting firm. After finishing a chrome extension for one of their applications (MileMarker), I was left without any very meaningful work, and left a few weeks later.

I was then left to work on Scout all day everyday, and this was my core focus for the next 10 months. I learned javascript, the chrome extension api, iframes, crazy css selectors, and a lot more about frontend development and javascript.

During these 10 months is when I moved to Silicon Valley. I continued doing freelance development for a handful of startups, with each one this time focusing on frontend/javascript development, half of them being chrome extensions. When I officially launched Scout, June 2012, I was at a cross-roads. I felt sufficiently satisfied with my progress on the extension and logically I should blog and stuff to gain traction. I went hunting for a good blog engine, but just couldn't find anything good enough. Following the build it yourself policy, I went searching for a great framework to build the better blog engine on. I dove deeper and deeper into open source and can say it's now one of my true loves in life.

TrackIf, JavaScript Development, December 2012 - March 2013

{{Explain what is TrackIf}}

 * Made first version of chrome extension bookmarklet and safari extension. Though it's been a year, I can proudly say the basic architecture is still the same. The loading animation is a little bit more choppy, but is still pretty good.

 * TraceKit.js, Stack traces and error collection, GitHub.com/occ/TraceKit
   - @occ Said “it’s been fun working with Devin on TraceKit :)”
   - Been working on a re-write Shield.js in my spare time.

Amobee, JavaScript Developer, Redwood City, March 2013 - August 2013 (4 months)

 * Developed ads in a proprietary ad xml language, and created development tools for abstracting and re-using chunks of xml.
 * I used EJS initially, it was then agreed upon pure xml isn't powerful enough, and I wrote tool with grunt to compile jade to xml.
