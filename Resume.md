### Summary

--consumer company (no sales team)

I've found the hardest thing with consumer products is hitting the perfect
balance of usability and capability for the audience that you happen to gather.

--company with sales team



I like making things very simple to start using, and then enabling new capabilities through the same simple interface.

I like doing things the best I can the first time around
I like making simple products excessively good

I've found the hardest thing to get right is making your product the easiest to use.
Always pursuing perfection. Fan of Ember, Tower, and Node. I've made a lot of complex
chrome extensions, and like to spend a large amount of my time working on javascript
libraries to make the web better.

I like using the latest CSS3 and HTML5 capabilities to push the limits of the browser.
I had a computer repair service in high school, and helping several old folk with their
computers makes me really care about the user experience.

I'm very passionate about open source, and want to be at a company where open source is
encouraged and preferably a core part of the culture.
